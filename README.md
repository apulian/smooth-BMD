This function numerically computes a smooth joint-minimum-variation Blochâ€“Messiah decomposition (see reference below) of a 2n-by-2n conjugate symplectic matrix-valued function FUN of one real parameter.

The singular values larger than 1 are arranged in decreasing order. The remaining singular values are organized such that the resulting diagonal matrix of singular values is symplectic. It is assumed that all singular values are distinct for every value of the parameter.

A typical call to smooth_BMD is:

Tout, Uout, Dout, Vout, flag = smooth_bmd(matfun, tspan)

See the script example_smooth_bmd.py for a usage example.
